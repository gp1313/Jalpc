### About Me
> Data Scientist with 5 years of work experience. I solve real world business problems leveraging my strong Machine Learning, Statistics and Computer Vision skills.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### MOBISY TECHNOLOGIES | DATA SCIENTIST

Mar 2018 - Present | Bangalore, IN

## Large Scale Object Detection Framework

- I lead research and development of image recognition solution as part of the
retail intelligence platform.
- Benchmark performance of various deep learning algorithms on retail images
and further fine-tune the algorithm which is best fit for project requirement.
- Address various shortcomings of existing algorithms, conduct experiments to
identify potential scope of improvements and design new approach.
- Build prototypes that showcases product capabilities.
- Working with cross functional team for API development and platform
integration.
- Object detection to digitize shelf space.
- Depth estimation and out-of-stock detection of ice-cream cabinets.

## Face Recognition for Attendance Module

- Training and deployment of a deep learning based Face Verification system in
existing attendance platform.
- Integrated with mobile application that uses GPS location and selfie images to
mark user’s attendance.

## Demand Forecasting

- Responsible for design and development of sophisticated machine learning
algorithms that involve learning from large amounts of business data, such as
historical transactions, promotions, product’s category, outlet’s category and
product’s attributes.
- I have proven my ability to identify specific and actionable opportunities to
solve business problems. My role was to translate these problem statements
into analytical questions that can be answered using existing data.

### ALLGO EMBEDDED | SOFTWARE ENGINEERING - MACHINE LEARNING

Dec 2015 – Feb 2018 | Bangalore, IN

## Deep learning based Driver Monitoring System

- As part of ADAS team, I was responsible for prototype development.
- Deep learning adoption : Replaced core modules such as face detection and
facial landmark detection with deep learning based algorithms.
- Before deep learning : Implemented research paper to develop initial
prototype, I made use OpenCV and Dlib library for most of the development.

## 360 Surround View for Parking Assistance System

- Design and development of fish-eye camera correction module, photo-metric
alignment module, camera calibration module.
- Design and development of multi-view image stitching algorithm.
- Redesign core modules for improvement in performance in terms of memory
and computation speed.
