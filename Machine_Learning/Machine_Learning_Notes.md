# Introduction

How do you define the field Machine Learning, well my advice is that you start by writing down what comes to your head when you think about Machine Learning and evaluate how good or bad is your definition and keep making small changes to improve it over next such iterations.

Or you can collect list of ideas that you think are important or are must have and make a defination out of it, then remove few ideas and check if quality of the definition significantly drops, keep those ideas for which drop in quality is significant

Or you can break down the idea of Machine Learning into simpler and more fundamental ideas. These fundamental ideas are very abstract in nature and when you connect such ideas to form more complex concepts you will notice gradual shift from abstract concepts to specific to machine learning concepts.

- Concept of Gradient Descent for model parameters optimization
- Tree Model Pruning
- Deep Neural Network's Hierarchy Learning

Definition of Machine Learning : 

> In field of machine learning. we write computer programs that learn to perform some desired task. The program is expected to learn from training data and improve its performance over that task.

Other interesting way of looking at machine learning program is by comparing it with a standard computer program, like the one we write to build a calculator.
